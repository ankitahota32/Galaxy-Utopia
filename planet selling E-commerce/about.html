                        reach.
                        Founded

                        magic

                        <p>Our Planets</p><br>
                        <i>Galaxy Utopia</i> was born out of a love for space and a desire to share<br> that fascination
                        with
                        others. Our founders, inspired by the<br> beauty and mystery of the stars, wanted to create
                        something<br> tangible that could capture the essence of distant worlds.<br> Combining their
                        expertise
                        in astronomy and design,<br> they set out to build a store like no other – a place where
                        imagination<br>
                        meets reality, and the universe is at your fingertips.<br>
